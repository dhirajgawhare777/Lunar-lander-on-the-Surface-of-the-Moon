Lunar Lander Deep Q-Learning
This project demonstrates the use of Deep Q-Learning with Experience Replay to train an agent to safely land a lunar lander on a landing pad in the OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander environment.

Instructions
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the train_lunar_lander.py script to train the agent. The trained model will be saved as lunar_lander_model.h5.
Run the test_lunar_lander.py script to see the trained agent in action and generate a video of its performance.
Files
train_lunar_lander.py: Script to train the agent using Deep Q-Learning.
test_lunar_lander.py: Script to test the trained agent and generate a video.
utils.py: Helper functions and classes for training and testing.
requirements.txt: List of required packages.
Notes
The training process may take several minutes to complete.
The trained model will be saved as lunar_lander_model.h5.
The videos folder will contain videos of the agent's performance.
